## Description

Sometimes while programming in NetBeans you want to explore a particular file that you are editing on the file system browser, or maybe launch a command in a terminal to do something with it.

This plugins brings to your NetBeans six action, three of them always available and three of them available when the selected node has a file assiociated with it. In particular:

_When the selection has a valid file:_

* **Open the default OS shell** on the location of the file (or its folder) selected.

* **Copy to the clipboard** the path of the file selected.

* **Open in default OS app** File opens in default app from the OS, not in NetBeans.
